# JavaScript-based tabbed component

To get started

1) clone the repo and install dependencies
2) Build the component with

```
npm run build
```

This will give you a set of files in `/dist` you can serve them from your file system.
Open `/dist/index.html` to interact with the component.

or visit http://bernardmordan.surge.sh if you are pushed for time.
